<!-- ░░░ end of badge wall, the actual README begins ░░░ -->

Yep. The code in this repo was written by AI. On purpose. Out loud. No
apologies, no asterisks, no "but I reviewed every line by hand" disclaimer.

I had ideas, I described them, and an AI built them. The result is software that
actually works and that I actually use. That's the whole point — and honestly,
it's awesome.

So this is the place where I stop pretending otherwise. The name is the
disclaimer. If "an AI wrote this" is a dealbreaker for you, this repo is not
going to win you over. If you think that's the most exciting thing about it —
welcome, you're going to like it here.

## What's in here

### Chrome extensions

Two extensions that do the same stubborn thing — give you back a feed made of
**only** the people you actually chose to see — on two platforms that really,
really don't want you to:

- **[Facebook Feed: Only Friends & Follows](chrome-extensions/facebook-remove-anything-i-dont-follow/)**
  — strips your Facebook home feed down to friends, Pages/people you follow, and
  groups you're in. Kills Sponsored ads, "Suggested for you", "People you may
  know", and Reels. Facebook fights this hard with randomized class names and
  scrambled, decoy-laden "Sponsored" labels, so the extension reconstructs the
  real visible text from element geometry instead of trusting the DOM.

- **[LinkedIn Feed: Only 1st Connections & Follows](chrome-extensions/linkedin-remove-anything-i-dont-follow/)**
  — strips your LinkedIn home feed down to posts from your 1st-degree
  connections and accounts you actually follow. Everything else — promoted ads,
  "Suggested" posts, strangers, and posts that only showed up because someone
  liked or reposted them — gets hidden.

And one that watches a feed instead of pruning it:

- **[Facebook Group: Player Wanted Alerts](chrome-extensions/facebook-group-player-wanted-alerts/)**
  — watches a Facebook group's chronological feed for *new* "our team needs
  fill-in players tonight" posts and fires a sticky desktop notification with
  the kick-off time and how many players they're short. Only new posts, never a
  backlog: a seen-set, a first-run baseline, and an age gate that understands
  this group holds posts for admin approval. Refreshes itself in the background,
  with or without a tab open.

### Web pages

Static pages, published from [`docs/`](docs/) to
[unashamedai.broadley.org.nz](https://unashamedai.broadley.org.nz):

- **[Lighthouses of New Zealand](docs/nz-lighthouses/)** — an animated night
  chart of 86 coastal lights, each sweeping or flashing to its published
  characteristic on one shared clock. No land is drawn: beams are ray-traced
  against the real coastline, so the country appears only where light strikes
  it. One HTML file, no build step, one outbound request (Google Fonts).
- **[Te Awa Kairangi Roadworks](docs/te-awa-kairangi-roadworks/)** — the
  weekly SH2 Melling / Te Wai Takamori o Te Awa Kairangi roadworks email for
  Lower Hutt, redrawn as an interactive map: every affected street coloured by
  what is happening and when, a week selector, and a "changes this week" view
  that diffs one email against the last. One HTML file, no build step, one
  outbound request (Google Fonts).
- **[Kiwi Businesses Going Under](docs/nz-insolvency-since-gfc/)** — New
  Zealand company liquidations from 2005 to August 2026, by year, sector and
  business size, counted in Isotype pictograms (one shopfront = 100 companies)
  and told like an in-flight magazine feature: who went under, how small they
  were, who sent them to court, and how it compares with 2009. One HTML file,
  no build step, one outbound request (Google Fonts).

Every Chrome extension also has a page on the site, at
`unashamedai.broadley.org.nz/<extension-folder>/`, restating its README in the
house style (generated by [`scripts/build-extension-pages.py`](scripts/build-extension-pages.py)).

Each project has its own README with the full how-it-works writeup.

## Why say it this way

Because the interesting story isn't "a human or an AI wrote this." It's that
describing what you want and getting working software back is real now, and
pretending otherwise is just noise. These projects scratch real itches. They
run. They're built in the open with AI front and center. That's the experiment,
and it's a good one.
